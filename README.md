# Getting Data from the Web from a Ruby Application

## Objectives

- define "getting data from the web"
- define "getting data from an API"
- define web scraping
- demonstrate getting data from the web and using that data to build Ruby objects

## You are always getting data from the web!  What?

- the web is a series of requests and responses
- usually, you're getting HTML
  - also CSS
  - also JavaScript

## API Consumption

Consuming an API means

### Some tools:

Ruby gems for accessing APIs:
- httparty
- rest-client
lots of others...

finding an api:
https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

## Scraping

Web scraping means

### A scraping tool:

- nokogiri

## Starting to put it together

Now we will:
- build a model class and use API consumption to build a bunch of objects
- build a model class and use scraping to build a bunch of objects

## Misc. Notes

In computer programming, remember functions are reusable chunks of code that can be called (invoked, executed).
Methods are functions that belong to an object, and are called on that object.  When we call a method on an object, the object is called the receiving object, or receiver.

In computer programming, there is the
POLV Principle of Least Visibility
or
POLP Principle of Least Privilege
